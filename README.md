# German_Flashcards
This program displays a card including a german word it waits three seconds and then flips the card and shows the English translation of the word. If the user clicks on the check mark it means that they guessed the word right so the word will be removed from the words to learn list and the program moves on to the next card, if they clicked the cross sign no removal takes place and the next card is shown. Also, there is a new data file created including all the words in the first run then whenever the user clicks known button the word is removed from that file when the program is runned again the data from the first run will be used so the progress of the user is not lost.
